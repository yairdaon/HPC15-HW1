Problem 1
---------
I wasn't able to use other CIMS machines, even though I followed the
instructions. Inside my machine, communication in the 2MB array problem is 
33,821,475 bytes/sec. When sending a single integer, I got 888.928699 bytes/sec.
It seems slower but here the overhead of runnig the OS etc. is much more 
significant.

Problem 2
---------
I did not observe strong scalability. My machine has four cores so using any 
number of processors bigger than four doesn't make sense. Going from two to
four processors did not improve runtime at all (actually, the run with 
four processors was a bit slower).
Parallelizling Gauss Seidel will bee much harder because every update any 
processor makes will immediately affect other processors. This is in sharp 
contrast to updates at the end of each iteration with Jacobi's method.
